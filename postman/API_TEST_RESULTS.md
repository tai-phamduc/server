## Test Results

### Movies API

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Response | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| `/api/movies` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns a list of movies | Successfully returns movie data |
| `/api/movies/:id` | GET | ❓ Not Tested | - | Need a valid movie ID to test |

### Users API

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Response | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| `/api/users/profile` | GET | ✅ Working | `{"message":"Not authorized, no token"}` | Authentication working as expected |
| `/api/users/login` | POST | ❓ Not Tested | - | Need to test with valid credentials |
| `/api/users/register` | POST | ❓ Not Tested | - | Need to test with valid user data |

### Cinemas API

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Response | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| `/api/cinemas` | GET | ✅ Working | Returns a list of cinemas | Successfully returns cinema data |
| `/api/cinemas/:id` | GET | ❓ Not Tested | - | Need a valid cinema ID to test |

### Screenings API

| Endpoint | Method | Status | Response | Notes |
|----------|--------|--------|----------|-------|
| `/api/screenings` | GET | ❌ Error | Server error | Returns "FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED" |
| `/api/screenings/:id` | GET | ❓ Not Tested | - | Need a valid screening ID to test |
| `/api/screenings/:id/seats` | GET | ✅ Working | `{"message":"Screening not found"}` | Correctly handles invalid screening ID |

## Issues Identified

1. **Screenings API Error**: The `/api/screenings` endpoint returns a server error. This needs to be investigated and fixed.

2. **Need Valid IDs for Testing**: To properly test the API endpoints that require specific IDs (like `/api/movies/:id`, `/api/cinemas/:id`, etc.), we need to extract valid IDs from the working endpoints.

3. **Authentication Required**: For endpoints that require authentication, we need to implement the login flow in Postman to obtain a valid JWT token.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Screenings API**: Investigate and fix the server error in the screenings endpoint.

2. **Update Postman Collections**: Update the existing Postman collections with valid IDs extracted from the working endpoints.

3. **Test Authentication Flow**: Implement and test the authentication flow in Postman to ensure that protected endpoints work correctly.

4. **Complete Testing**: Test all endpoints in the existing Postman collections to ensure they work as expected.

5. **Create Missing Collections**: Create Postman collections for the models that don't have them yet (as listed in MISSING_COLLECTIONS.md).

## Conclusion

The API is partially working, with some endpoints functioning correctly and others returning errors. The issues identified need to be addressed before proceeding with creating new Postman collections for the missing models.
